# Get to know Firebase for Flutter (codelab)
A completed run-through of the tutorial:

https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firebase-get-to-know-flutter

I believe the completed tutorial code still falls under the license found at the root of this repository:

## My Extension

I modified it so that you can say that you are coming with a party of multiple people when you RSVP.
Setting your party size to 0 is the same as saying you aren't going.


## EOL

I may disable the firebase part of this later if I am cleaning out my Google cloud.
So if you are reading this in the far future, this probably doesn't work anymore.
